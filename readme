1. Please create public repository on github or any other public code repository
website
2. Create a REST endpoint called calculate available at port 8989 so we can
access it http://localhost:8989/calculate
3. Use https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter for creating a server
4. Calculate endpoint has to take json with following structure
{"a":int,"b":int} and calculate factorial of a and b using goroutines
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial
5. Calculate will return json with the a! and b!
6. Please create middleware which will check if a and b exists in json and they
are non-negative int in case of failure return json { "error":"Incorrect
input"} with error status code 400 Bad Request
